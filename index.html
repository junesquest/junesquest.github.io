     <p>Welcome to my website! I created this as a Quest project from scratch using what I learned of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a>.</p>

 <div class="header2">Advice for Incoming Freshies/Students New to Herricks HS</div>
  <div class="container">
    <p>Herricks is a competitive school district located in Nassau County, New York, about 15 minutes' driving distance from Queens. Known for its students' motivation and success in music, science, math, writing, and social studies, it has become a hotspot for families seeking an academically challenging school climate.</p>
    <h6>So what does this mean?</h6>
    <p>For students moving to Herricks from other areas, there may be a slight culture shock upon becoming accustomed to the high school. I have taken the liberty of creating a table to compare issues common in many high schools with issues common at Herricks HS, which should tell you a bit about the environment here, should you opt to join the academically-oriented frenzy:</p>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Issues commonly expected in high school</th>
          <th>Issues commonly seen at Herricks HS</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Possible violence, fights in hallways</td>
          <td>Yelling matches over the correct answer to a math problem</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Students clogging hallways while gossipping with their friends</td>
          <td>Students clogging hallways doing last-minute review together for the quiz in 5 minutes</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Students oversleep and come late to class or cut</td>
          <td>Students brag about staying up till 3am or later to finish a project or essay</td>
        <tr>
          <td>Students cut class to go out for lunch</td>
          <td>Students cut lunch period to add another class to their schedule</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Students envy others for their good looks/athletic capabilities</td>
          <td>Students envy others for their good looks/athletic capabilities/status as a board member of Model UN/award-winning science research project/97 average in Physics C</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
